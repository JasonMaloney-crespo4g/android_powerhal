PowerHAL Binaries for Herring, Tuna & Grouper

Herring - Crespo / Crespo4G (Nexus S)
Tuna - Maguro / Toro / ToroSpr (Nexus Prime)

These binaries support the ondemand boostpulse interface, which enables ondemand 
to be as buttery as interactive without the expensive overhead of interactive.

Instructions:
herring: place in /system/lib/hw
tuna: rename the existing /system/lib/hw/power.tuna.so then replace with mine.

grouper: rename the existing /system/vendor/lib/hw/power.grouper.so and replace with mine.

Source is in the patch files here. Just apply to the respective device vendors.
