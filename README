PowerHAL Binaries for Crespo, Maguro & Grouper

These binaries support the ondemand boostpulse interface, which enables ondemand 
to be as buttery as interactive without the expensive overhead of interactive.

Instructions:
crespo: place in /system/lib/hw
maguro: rename the existing /system/lib/hw/power.tuna.so then replace with mine.

grouper: rename the existing /system/vendor/lib/hw/power.grouper.so and replace with mine.

Source is on my github in the various device_blah_blah repos.
